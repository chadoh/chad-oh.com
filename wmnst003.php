            	<p>Whoa, there's a lot to say about this one.</p>
				<p>This project spanned two weeks of class, and we generated a whole lot of material. Here's the assignment
				for the first week:</p>
				<p style="margin-left:20px;">borrow a female character from film, literature, TV, popular culture, or this 
				course (one of the artists we have covered). Write her name and a brief biography of the woman you choose.
				Then write your name and brief biography of yourself. If you are a guy, you will need to invent a female 
				persona for yourself (Thomas becomes Thomasina or whatever name you choose), including a biography. 
				Everyone should feel free to take liberties with her/his own bios and personas. This does not have to be 
				"true confessions." Offer up any version of "you" you want.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:20px">Post once per day in either personae of your 
				character, for a total of four pages plus your bios. These will be posted as a reply to your original posts. 
				Your characters can write to each other, have totally separate posts, or morph into and out of each other 
				within one post. The narrative you construct should weave together your two characters or at least have 
				them encounter each other in the letters. The characters and their lives may or may not have something to 
				do with you. But you are in effect melding a version of yourself with a pre-established or “real life” 
				person, character, celebrity, or personality.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:20px">Think about what you have learned over the course of the semester about the 
				daily lives of women, about femininity and the gaze, etc.</p>
				<p>These were my posts:</p>
				<h4>Monday: Meeting the Characters: Erica Ostrowski & Juno MacGuff</h4>
				<p>Erica Ostrowski:</p>
				<p>Born 14 March 1987, middle child, two brothers. I know the middle child is supposed to have identity 
				issues, people would always say "ooh, middle child, huh?" in a foreboding manner, as if I would end up 
				with deep-set emotional problems. Not sure where this idea came from. My childhood was just fine, my parents 
				did a good job of loving all three of us equally (even my younger brother, who required much more discipline 
				than we older two), and though my younger brother was insufferably annoying to me when we were young, I 
				never felt marginalized because of my place in the birth order or because of my chromosomal make-up.</p>
				<p>I went to school for IST at Penn State! Then got bored by their first class and switched to engineering 
				science, which has about a 40% female makeup. Ok, maybe 30%. But that's a lot better than IST or EE, the 
				second major I picked up. Yes, I have two engineering majors. That didn't feel at all weird, coming from 
				my family: my dad was always better at interior design than my mom, and he would help my mom match her 
				clothes. Though they recoil at the suggestion that they are feminists. Anyhow, I think my passion to be 
				good at technology came from feeling inferior to my older brother when he started taking an interest to 
				computers in high school. Now he majored in theatre and I in engineering. Go figure.</p><br/>
				<p>Juno MacGuff</p>
				<p>Born 19 May 1991 to Mac and not the woman I grew up with for most of my life (Brenda), who is the 
				mother of my younger sister, Liberty Bell. My dad's really into heating and air conditioning and has 
				always been supportive of me. Brenda, too, really. Even when I got pregnant to my best friend Bleeker 
				when I was sixteen. I gave the baby to a woman named Vanessa, who really wanted to be a mom.</p>
				<p>I don't think the fact that I'm a female has affected my status in society that greatly. When I 
				was little I was always far more concerned with the fact that I'm a "year behind" everyone else in my 
				grade. I'll turn 19 right at the end of my senior year this coming May.</p>
				<p>I think I've made peace with the fact that I'll go to school somewhere next year. Brenda's brother 
				works at Penn State, so I'm trying to convince her and my dad to let him adopt me so I get a 75% 
				discount. I don't know what I'd go for. Something mathy, probably. I mean, I love playing music, but I 
				can do that while I'm in school. I'm trying to convince Bleeker to go there, too. He applied, but we're 
				still waiting for acceptance letters. He's worried about how much it would cost.</p>

				<h4>Tuesday: Engineering Science Outreach blog post by Erica on 15 October 2009, in a series on "How has 
				Engineering Science helped shape your future?"</h4>
				<p>This is of course an unanswerable question, but I'll gladly tell you how it has shaped the last four 
				years. My goal before I came to school was to be a rock-star, a writer, and an inventor. I figured I should 
				go to school for the third one, and my interest in the other two would take me to those goals.  Basically 
				exactly four years ago I was feeling deeply dissatisfied with the major I had started in, IST (other 
				technical majors joke that this stands for "I Stopped Trying", really it stands for Information Sciences 
				and Technology). I think this was entirely because the first IST class, IST 110, doesn't actually teach 
				anything, it just tells you that you'll have an awesome job someday because of the major. They fail to 
				specify doing what. I became distressed that I wouldn't be able to actually invent things after completing 
				the major, and so I switched to Engineering Science.</p>
				<p>Interestingly, now that I've finished four years, my invention aspirations have morphed into 
				start-a-business aspirations, which has lead me to pursue web design more passionately. And so IST probably 
				would have worked, after all. But a good friend in IST tells me how awesome it is that I did engineering, 
				because "[I] actually know things." So it's similar to where I was four and a half years ago. I can do web 
				design in my own time, but had I majored in it, I wouldn't be able to do engineering on the side.</p>
				<p>So, Engineering Science has given me options. I have more open doors than almost any other major, 
				presumably. And the confidence that gives me is awesome.</p>

				<h4>Wednesday: Juno's personal statement on her application to Penn State, explaining the importance-to-her 
				of one of her interests; and her email to Erica, who she discovered through the blog post above</h4>
				<p>The personal statement:</p>
				<p>I listed Paulie Bleeker as one of my interests. He's my boyfriend. I know, super lame for a high schooler 
				to be so into their SO, but that's why I wanted to explain the interest in my personal statement. Bleeker was 
				the reason I had a baby two years ago. I'm intentionally avoiding the word "father" or "dad" because he is no 
				such thing: I put it up for adoption. Bleeker and I didn't really start dating until after I already had the 
				baby. That's backwards, I'm aware. But anyhow, that's why Bleeker's one of my interests, I'm not just being 
				pathetic. No matter what happens, I'm thinking he'll cross my mind more than most other things/people over 
				the course of my life. He might be a more permanent fixture in my brain than whatever career I end up choosing 
				and then ditching a few years later.</p><br/>
				<p>The email:</p>
				<p>hey Erica. I read your thing about engineering science. you don't mention if you're a rockstar yet. as far 
				as i can tell you aren't. do you blame engineerng science?</p>
				<p>thanks,</p>
				<p>juno</p>

				<h4>Thursday: Erica's response to Juno's email</h4>
				<p>Hola, Juno.</p>
				<p>I suppose, maybe, in a way. Not E Sc specifically, but all of school as kept me far more busy than I would like. I've still managed to carve out some time to write songs with friends, but we never really figured out the business of playing shows, and that's what gets people to rockstar-status. Anyhow, being a rockstar is lame--I'd be happy to get payed for playing music at all. Even if it were a self-sufficient hobby that would be cool.</p>
				<p>All-in-all, though, I'm glad for school. Sometimes I feel like it gets in the way of my real life (writing songs, developing web sites), but I still have faith that it will work out for my benefit. If you're unsure of what you want to do but want a great background, go with E Sc. If you really want to pursue playing music, you can still do that on the side. Just don't wait until you're a senior, because you'll be busy.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, check out my music <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theroaringkittens">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Thanks for emailing me! No one has ever done that from one of those silly blog posts before. But they pay five bucks a piece for them, so it still pays off.</p>
				<p>Erica</p>

				<h4>Friday: Juno's response to Erica</h4>
				<p>thanks, Erica.</p>
				<p>five bucks is pretty sweet.</p>
				<p>sometimes i don't know if i even feel like going to school. my step mom runs her own business without going to more than a year of beauty school, and my dad's official schooling only took the equivalent of two years and he loves what he does, so that still gives me a couple years to figure out what i want to do. and I know it's super lame, but i'd hate to be too far from my friend Bleeker right now. i mean, five hours would even be acceptable for me (probably not for him, though), but if he stays here in minnesota and I end up at penn state, eh. probably not worth the 75% discount i'd get if my uncle adopted me.</p>
				<p>anyhow, thanks for letting me know that i'd have time to have fun even if i majored in something kinda hard.</p>

				<h3 class="post-title" id="letters2">Letters Project Part 2</h3>
				<p>In this part of the project, we were to continue other students' stories in the same manner that we had been elaborating
				on our own in Part 1. Only instead of developing our own characters, we were to develop a character someone else had
				created. This also meant that other students continued my story.</p>
				<p>After allowing other students to develop my story for four days, I was to come back and write the final entry. I was
				also to create self-portraits of me-as-my-characters, and then say how the whole Letters Project made me feel.</p>

				<h4>Jaclyn Aylward's continuation of the story: Erica's response to Juno</h4>
				<p>Juno</p>
				<p>Five bucks is definitely nice but wow 75% off tuition is amazing!!!  I mean I’m not sure if you can really get your uncle to adopt you and get the discount, but if you definitely can I say go for it.  Five hours is a bit far, but time flies while you’re here.  Ideally, your friend Bleeker would come here too but if not, you guys could find a few weekends to visit each other each semester.  As far as not knowing if you want to go to school right away or take some time off, you still have time before you get your acceptances back to think and decide what is best for you.  In the mean time, I suggest researching the different schools you applied to and possible majors.  You are probably just hesitating because it is a big decision and you are not sure what you want to do yet.  You mentioned math, which is a great subject to major in and maybe you’re interested in engineering since you were on the blog.  Also, if music is something you want to pursue you could major in it, minor in it, take some classes as electives or join a club.  I know you live pretty far away, but if you’re visiting your uncle anytime soon I recommend taking a campus tour and talking with advisers or students from the colleges you are interested in.  I know it is a difficult choice but the more you learn the easier it will be.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions about my major or Penn State in general please feel free to ask.</p>

				<h4>Noah Johnson's continuation of the story: Juno's response to Erica</h4>
				<p>Erica</p>
				<p>While I'd love to come to Penn State I just don't think I have enough motivation to gain a lot of knowledge in something I'm really not that interested in. Unless Penn State offers Bleekernomics I don't think I'll be leaving my dude anytime soon. I mean we can always go to University of Minnesota together right? Go Golden Gophers! I've always liked gophers anyway, those furry little guys. I don't know how you've done it for so long, studying Eng.Sci. You must be very motivated and enjoy it a lot. I think I'd probably last a year, if that, in college. I could just start popping out babies but I don't think Bleeker is ready for that yet. The first one hit him pretty hard and we had some rough times because of it. Have you ever thought about babies? I guess you probably haven't, so focused on your schoolwork and music. Well good for you, to each her own.</p>

				<h4>Noah Johnson's continuation of the story: Erica's response to Juno</h4>
				<p>Juno,</p>
				<p>To be honest I don't think I'll be settling down anytime soon. I'm hoping to start up writing and playing regularly after graduation and, all things go well, I'll be on tour pretty much all the time in a couple years. That just isn't really the time or right situation to have a serious relationship. Guys just don't want to follow a girl around and rely on her for income. Unless of course I could be so lucky as to find someone to perform with and love but its just not probable. Don't get me wrong, I'm so jealous of what you and Bleeker have, I just don't see a serious relationship working for me anytime soon because of my plans for fame. I'm sorry you don't think Penn State is right for you, but I do understand. If you really didn't mind the pregnancy I say go for it again! I know Bleeker may not be ready for you guys to keep one for yourselves but if that's the case you can always put it up for adoption again. I bet you made that one lady the happiest woman in the world and I know there are plenty more loving couples out there looking for exactly what you can provide them with!</p>

				<h4>Noah Johnson's continuation of the story: Juno's response to Erica</h4>
				<p>Erica,</p>
				<p>Maybe you're right. Maybe I should get busy again. I mean, Vanessa was indefinitely grateful to me for giving her my little dude, it's a great way to make friends for life. To be honest the only thing stopping me is the thought that I could be setting a really bad example for Liberty Bell. I don't want her to think that she can go ahead and start baby-making at age 15. On the subject of your tours, I hope it happens for you! My only other advice is you gotta find that guy Erica. I can tell you that without Bleeker in my life everything would just be... bleaker! I know you can do it, just start holding jam sessions and you can get a good sense of some of the guys there based on how interested they are in touring with you. I bet you'll be surprised dude. </p>
				<p>Juno</p>
            	<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
				<h4>Noah Johnson's continuation of the story: Erica's response to Juno</h4>
				<p>Juno,<p>
				<p>Thanks for the bid of confidence! It's one of those things where I know if I put my mind to it, it'll happen. I mean thats how everyone starts right? All it takes is a little bit of talent and a strong desire. All I have to do is keep my mind set on my goal and not back ever back down. You're actually a bit of a role model for me in that sense. It must've taken so much courage to do what you did for Vanessa and a I bet you felt like backing out so many times. You did the right thing though and thats what counts. I think you definitely should talk to Liberty Bell though, it's not for everyone and she could get the wrong impression if you don't sit her down and talk about it. </p>

				<h4>My Final Letter, the completion of the story: Juno's response to Erica</h4>
				<p>This email comes some time after the last one.</p>
				<p>Yo, Erica.</p>
				<p>Just to clear things up, I'm not going to start making babies just for fun and friends. I haven't seen Vanessa since before the baby, anyhow. I mean, we had "a traditional closed adoption", so I'm not really supposed to see her ever.</p>
				<p>I got into Penn State, but not the main campus. And my parents are being TOTALLY lame about letting my uncle adopt me. "That just wouldn't be honest, June Bug," my dad says. So, I'm not going.</p>
				<p>I don't know why I feel like I should tell you this, but I do. I won't be coming to Penn State. Sorry, I guess? I mean, not that we would have met each other anyhow, but when I saw your email in my inbox I felt like i should tell you for some reason.</p>
				<p>I hope things are going well for you. I hope you find someone as awesome as Bleeker to play music with and love.</p>
				<p>Nice kind of meeting you.</p><br/>
				<p>I have a friend who has this theory that angels/God draw a bunch of scribbles with their eyes closed on the canvas of the world. A scribble for each of us. And your scribble determines your life. So it's kind of "predetermined", but it's still essentially random. When your scribble crosses my scribble, it shows a time when we meet each other.</p>
				<p>I find it interesting that about 300 years ago the only way to meet someone was to, you know, meet them. So I'm wondering if our life-scribbles have crossed at all. Do emails count as intersections on some cosmic canvas?</p>
				<p>Peace out, Homes. Nice intersecting with you.</p>

				<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
				<h3 class="post-title" id="lettersReflections">Letters Project Reflections</h3>
				<p>I suspect that you may find it interesting to know that I much more enjoyed adding to someone else's story than I did writing my own. Perhaps it was the mood I am in today as opposed to last week, but I found creating my own characters to be a terrible dilemna. I was not very inspired. I made the female-me basically like the real (male) me for ease of creation, and I deliberated for an hour or more which female character from pop culture to use. I settled on Juno MacGuff because I feel like I can use her vocabulary easily, and I felt like I knew a decent bit about her. After writing as her, though, I realized that I knew very little. We draw from an overwhelming resevoir of experience when we write anything, and to write as another person is a difficult task indeed.</p>
				<p>However, when I looked at Shawn Taylor's writings, he already created plot! And so all I had to do was flesh it out. I knew enough about Frida Kahlo to speak fairly confidently as her (in a "I'm imagining what Frida would be like if she were alive today, and also if she were me!" kind of way), and the story/character-development just sort of flowed. It was much easier than writing my story, for which I also needed to create some semblance of plot (though I attempted to barely make one, in the post-modern tradition of denying that there are any story-lines).</p>
				<p>I've said this before, but I always try to see a world without gender. I fail immeasurably, to be sure, but I don't see what role gender plays, other than the fact that I have never been a woman and therefore it is more difficult to write as if I am one. I kept imagining "Shawntay," in the story I was adding to, was a man, that the character was the creator, Shawn. Likewise, in my story, I kept forgetting that the character of me was in fact a female version of me. But! I insist that it shouldn't matter. (That is, I feel slightly silly admitting that my dream was to be a rockstar, a writer, and an inventor, and were I female I would hope I would feel no less and no more silly for wanting these things.)</p>
				<p>As far as having other's write my story: I found this very strange. I thought it would be more fun that it was. Some of the results were fabulous, but at other times the characters said things that I, their creator!, could never see them saying. "That's not what she would say!!" I exclaimed. However, though when I was writing originally and kept forgetting that the "me" character was a female, coming back to the story after other's interventions made that a much more difficult thing to forget. I was much more convinced that Erica was a female after others added to it.</p>
				<p>(I suppose this speaks to the way we identify ourselves by what others say of us--I find it much more easy to work with a character once others have also given her definition. It is probably true of ourselves, also. Being fairly uncertain of what our character (our self) ought to be like, we take what other's say about our selves as our own definition, and expound on it from there. Occasionally, they'll say things about our selves that we know we definitely are not, but this to also serves to aid our self-construction: before they said it, we were more nebulous. Now we have something to revolt against, a corner of our self that we can securely, knowingly lean on.)</p>

            <!--begin .post--><h3 class="post-title" id="selfportrait4">Self-Portrait 4: Film Stills</h3>
            <div class="post-body">
            	<p>Film stills, inspired by <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1997/sherman/index.html">Cindy Sherman</a>.
				I am to describe the film in which I star, why I wrote it, 
				and how successful the images are at interrogating notions of femininity, the gaze, and spectatorship.</p>
				<br /><a href="images/filmstills/Bumming.png"><img title="The Poster of Homelessness" alt="Picture of bum being rejected in his quest for money" src="images/filmstills/BummingSmall.PNG" /></a>
				<p>In this film I depict a bum asking for money. I do not get money.</p>
				</p>Honestly, I just had fun making these film stills, but basically all of them ended up portraying men who seem 
				to have no skills or gumption. Which is how men are portrayed in pop culture, for the most part. From Homer
				Simpson to every Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell character, to the dolts in The Hangover.</p>
				<br /><a href="images/filmstills/FeedingSquirrels.png"><img title="Feeding Squirrels instead of Learning" alt="Reaching hands-full-of-bird-seed towards squirrels, off-camera" src="images/filmstills/FeedingSquirrelsSmall.PNG" /></a>
				<p>In this film I am depicted reaching hands full of bird seed towards squirrels. There were actual squirrels right off "screen", who unfortunately
				did not see fit to come close enough to be in the shot. Insofar as the entire allure of spectatorship is built
				upon seeing others do things that we may do but cannot observe ourselves doing, I would say it fits the criteria
				of interrogating the notion of spectatorship. Also, it perhaps shows an example of an activity that most of
				us are usually far too sadly busy to enjoy.</p>
				<br /><a href="images/filmstills/CigaretteHaver.png"><img title="A Dapper-Looking Man with a Cigarette" alt="He sits in a jazz-club, looking surprised" src="images/filmstills/CigaretteHaverSmall.PNG"/></a>
				<p>This still is from a film in which this dapper bloke attempts to enjoy a cigarette in a jazz club and is 
				bugged by the fellow in the next image. This character seems like he might be the only character I've dreamt
				up who has a job and gets along well in society. But truth be told, I'm not even sure about that. The 
				characters we may most want to emulate are inaccessible and quirky.</p>
				<br /><a href="images/filmstills/CigaretteWanter.png"><img title="A Dirty-Looking Man Slouching Wantingly" alt="He sits in a jazz-club, looking dirty" src="images/filmstills/CigaretteWanterSmall.PNG"/></a>
				<p>This character falls much more in-line with all the others I've created, again playing off of traditional
				depictions of visionless, pitiful men in popular culture. I find it interesting, though, that while we who 
				take women's studies courses think about these things and somehow differentiate that Cindy Sherman's and my 
				works are illuminating the stereotypes that popular culture so strongly reinforces, to everyone else it may
				simply seem that we are further reinforcing them ourselves. Have I done so by setting up these films? Perhaps.</p>
				<br /><a href="images/filmstills/FumanchuSwing.png"><img title="Well, Ah Dohn No." alt="A man with ugly facial hair stands beneath a leafless tree beneath a white sky, holding a swing." src="images/filmstills/FumanchuSwingSmall.PNG"/></a>
				<p>This character is out-of-touch with current style, but not on purpose for the sake of irony. He honestly
				thinks that the fumanchu is a trendy lady-catcher. He does tricks on <del>his</del> a child's swing, hoping
				to woo on-lookers. No one comes close.</p>
				<p>It's fun to dream up worthless characters. Perhaps for the same reason Cindy Sherman found it fun to dream
				up female clichés for her film stills ("She stopped, she has explained, when she ran out of clichés"). Though
				I do question the ability this sort of commentary has to cause spectators to ponder the stereotypes they 
				depict. I know I just generally get involved in the clichés the same way I do with actual pop-culture.</p>

				Still only five tributaries none of which with hydrogen, plus molasses. Molasses and molasses and molasses,

				Slide drawer, remove knife, wind two in one with both arms to remove (differently colored!) lid and simply 
				spread. No stirring. No stirring! My goodness how laborious. How thoughtful. Thank you, Jif.</p>
				<p>I wonder if Jeff could eat it and probably not, makes his own with a blender before each sandwich.</p>
				<p>But how much increased enjoyment comes from the brown lid instead of the two percent or less of the following.</p>

				Two rooms in one with a wall of simply space and what in each, a Dining and a Living? A Gaming and a Watching? A 
				Passive and inactive. A passing unattractive. Perhaps one oh my goodness great hall with a forest of indoor 
				shrubbery and solid oaken table. Not very clever. Not very clever at all.</p>

				<h3 class="post-title" id="kyle-versions">Experimentation: Reworkings by Kyle Carroza</h3>
				<p>The next part of the assignment was to perform some sort of experiment on our poems. There was a long list
				of experiments. I chose one in which a friend writes my poems, pretending to be me, and then I merge mine and 
				his. I consider Kyle to be a better poet than myself, and so am fairly honored that he was willing to 
				participate. Here are his poems: 
				<h4>Cardboard Box</h4>
				<p>A grave. A grave absence.
				<br/>Not a thing but the lack of a thing.
				<br/>Empty space. Space the things,
				<br/>divide them, place them
				<br/>in their graves. Still.
				<br/>A grave. Movement of the things.
				<br/>Moving is a grave matter.
				<br/>The movement of matter
				<br/>is a grave thing. It’s not
				<br/>a matter of the thing,
				<br/>of the empty space but
				<br/>a matter of emptying the space
				<br/>into another empty space.
				<br/>A lack of space for matter
				<br/>so that the things remain,
				<br/>the matter remains. But
				<br/>the matter of lacking space
				<br/>is no longer a matter.
				<br/>A grave absence of lacking
				<br/>space is gone. Not
				<br/>into a grave. Absent.</p>
				<h4>Peanut Butter</h4>
				<p>A jar, brown, earthy, organic.
				<br/>Ground up peanuts up from the earth,
				<br/>Earth’s organs up from the ground.
				<br/>Ground up. Spreadable. Earthy and edible.
				<br/>From ground peanuts you have come,
				<br/>to the Earth’s ground you shall return.
				<br/>Toasted peanuts. Earth’s organs roasted.
				<br/>Roasted earth, scorched earth.
				<br/>Soldiers starve. Buried.</p>
				<h4>Great Room</h4>
				<p>This is the space for the king and queen. This is the space for laughing. This is the space for reading or 
				watching TV. Meals, no doubt. A great room.</p>
				<p style="font-decoration:italic;">This is a great room. I like what you’ve done with the place.</p>
				<p>It’s nothing but four walls. And a table&mdash;two, actually. And a television. And some windows. And a pile of 
				books. And some humans. It’s nothing but four walls, a couple of tables, a television, some windows, some humans, 
				and some other things, which, at any given prime time television hour may or may not include the king, the queen, 
				or both.</p>
				<p>But those windows that look out over the yard, the small but cozy yard with a couple of trees, birds that chirp 
				too early in the morning, and the neighbor's cat&mdash;that keeps pissing in the garden, but he’s cute, so we’ll let him 
				be&mdash;those windows have a great view. It’s such a nice yard.</p>
				<p>Let’s go build some walls around it. </p>
				<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
				<h3 class="post-title" id="merged-versions">Experimentation: Merging of the Versions</h3>
				<p>The final task was to merge the two versions of each poem into one. Here are the results:</p>
				<h4>Boxes</h4>
				<p>A grave packing. Packing a grave.
				<br/>Absently packing for an absence.
				<br/>Absently absent. Empty space.
				<br/>Not a thing but the lack of a thing.
				<br/>Spacing matter and rooms and lives.
				<br/>Dividing, movement. Fog, still.
				<br/>A grave matter, fog. A grave matter, packing.
				<br/>A grave floating, moving matter.
				<br/>The matter of floating, with grave boxes
				<br/>full of memories, full of necessities,
				<br/>full of space. A matter of emptying the space
				<br/>into another empty space. Lacking matter
				<br/>to move would make emptying less a matter.
				<br/>But a grave matter, removing matter,
				<br/>hard to feel at home there in its lacking. Where
				<br/>Someday we'll know.</p>
				<h4>Peanut Butter</h4>
				<p>A brown earthy jar, instead of red commercial.
				<br/>Ground up organic peanuts from the ground
				<br/>with No Stirring Required.
				<br/>Earth's organs up from the ground, with molasses.
				<br/>Molasses and peanuts ground up, spreadable,
				<br/>without stir. Molasses surely firming,
				<br/>ensuring consistency spreadable, edible, earthy.
				<br/>To the Earth's ground peanuts you shall return.
				<br/>Toasted peanuts, earth's organs roasted,
				<br/>with brown jar to hide molasses and other lessers.
				<br/>Roasted earth, scorched earth.
				<br/>Soldiers starve. Buried. </p>
				<h4>Great Room</h4>
				<p>This is the space for the king and queen,
				<br/>a space for laughing and socially circling,
				<br/>laughing hopefully that Oh Isn't This A Clever Set Up and
				<br/>This is a great room. I like what you've done with the place.
				<br/>Four walls. Two tables. A television. Some windows.
				<br/>A pile of books. A book on Clever Greatrooms.
				<br/>Some humans who contemplate—who may or may not
				<br/>include the king, the queen, or both—which way
				<br/>to split it up. Five walls, one of space
				<br/>to separate two thoughts, two rooms in one great room.
				<br/>A Dining and a Living? A Gaming and a Watching?
				<br/>A Passive and inactive. A passing unattractive.
				<br/>A king and queen. </p>
				<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
				<h3 class="post-title" id="modernist-poems-reflections">Modernist Poetry Reflections</h3>
				<p>This was fun for me. I liked how my poems turned out originally. I enjoyed writing with more of a 
				flowing style and merging thoughts together, and I think it produced some fun works. For the experiments, 
				it occured to me that Kyle understood the mechanics of Gertrude Stein much better than I had. (He attempted 
				to write as me attempting to write as Gertrude.) I liked both of ours enough that I felt a little sad, twisting 
				them together into something new. That being said, I think every iteration of each of these stands on its own. 
				The final results were as good as the other two. I had to remove ideas which didn't quite fit anymore, ideas 
				which I had originally loved, which was the saddest part, but I think it was for the best. </p>

            <div class="post-body">
            	<p>For our third self-portrait, we were to create a "quilt" inspired by the works of <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ug97/quilt/harriet.html">Harriet Powers</a>.
				Only, rather than convey bible stories or astronomical events, my comic-quilt was to tell about my family history:</p>
				<p>"Draw a comic strip that details your family history, either where they came from, how they got here, where they 
				settled and what they did, or detail one significant event in the history of the family."</p>
				<p>While I love the simplicity of Harriet's quilt illustrations, I couldn't think of a characteristic
				event in my family history that could be illustrated in such a way. There is so much family history!
				I could do my grandmother's parents immigrating from Lebanon, but what about my grandfather's parents
				immigrating from Poland in the same decade? And if I went with a general "immigration" theme, what of
				my ancestors who have been on this continent for millenia? (Somewhere back, my other grandfather received
				genes from someone in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot">Niitsítapi</a>.)</p>
				<p>I wanted to incorporate as many nationhoods that I knew contributed to the creation of me.</p>
				<p>Sadly, my illustration & history skills were not up to the task. Thus, I searched for images that 
				did it better than I could:</p>
				<a href="images/origins_large.jpg"><img src="images/origins.jpg" title="The Melting Pot" alt="A lot of foreign travel, coelescing into me"/></a>
				<p>At the top left is a Blackfoot (Niitsítapi) man, who perhaps had a kinsmen donate some life to my cause in 
				the tragic decade of the 1850s. At top center are German stamps from 1852, which may have been used by my
				German ancestors. On the right is a painting of the Siege of Pskov by a Polish King. A Russian painted this in 1852,
				during which year Poland technically didn't exist, a third of it being Russianized. Mass famine in the 1890s 
				started an immense wave of emigration, on which my dad's dad's parents rode. On the bottom are the timeless
				Cedars of Lebanon; one such tree still graces the flag of my dad's mom's ancestry. And on the bottom left
				is an English building from the 1850s, at war with the MacAlister tartan behind all of it. Though somewhere
				in the eternal fray between England and Scotland it would seem my mom's mom's ancestors saw through the 
				conflict.</p>
				<p>And in the center, derivative of all of it, is me.</p>

            <div class="post-body">
            	<p>For our second self-portrait, we were told to "create one self-portrait triptych from a series 
				of three images, ... you can choose three of your most prized possessions to be photographed with, one 
				shot per object to form your triptych. Another way to approach this assignment is to make a series of 
				self-portraits like those we have viewed for this lesson. Many women artists portray themselves in 
				action, or at least with the tools of their trade in the image to mark their professions (paintbrushes, 
				canvases, etc.). You can make three images, including a job you had in the past, one you have now, and one 
				you would like to have in the future."</p>
				<p>I don't identify much with objects in my life, and I don't identify with job decisions or whatever career
				I'll have, nor do I have a trade right now that I might wield characteristic tools. But what I can say decisively about
				my current self is that I approach technical projects creatively and approach creative projects more
				analytically. Also, my wife (wife! such a strange word to get used to!) Lisa is pretty awesome. Thus:</p>
				<p><a href="images/self-portraitTriptychHuge.jpg"><img src="images/self-portraitTriptych.jpg" title="three mees" alt="Picture of me using a balloon as an iPod, Picture of Lisa kissing me in a picture frame, Picture of me using an iPod as a balloon."/></a></p>
            	<p>I am portrayed in the first image with my iPod (technological pursuits) replaced with a balloon
				(creative approach). In the third this situation is reversed, with creative pursuits (my "balloon")
				being approached technically/technologically (iPod). The middle one depicts the most important person
				in my life and is quite literal.</p>

				<p style="margin-left: 20px">shoot and upload a picture of the back of your head (much like <a href="http://www.learner.org/catalog/extras/wabios/simpson.html">Lorna Simpson</a>'s and <a href="http://www.mocp.org/collections/permanent/dunning_jeanne.php">Jeanne Dunning</a>'s works).

				<p>My gendered self thinks the back of my head reminds me of <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com">Neil Gaiman</a>, which thus reminds me of England. I therefore consider the back of my gendered head to look British and exotic. My whole gendered illustrious mane.</p>

                <br /><br/>
                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    Using <a title="de Pizan's &quot;City of Ladies&quot;" href="http://www.pinn.net/%7Esunshine/march99/pizan3.html" id="nj6o">de Pizan's "City of Ladies"</a>
                    reading as a starting point, your
                    job is to construct one building in our own contemporary version called
                    "Women's World." If women could design and build sites to accommodate
                    their every need, how might that change the landscape? Would buildings
                    still appear as phallic totems with doors for entrances and exits? How 
                    might women's desires and needs shape the function of the buildings? 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is your turn to architect a site. First, make a list of where women
                    find the things they need, what they want, where/how they dwell, how
                    they move around from space to space. Pick a function to design around.
                    Who goes to/lives in your building? Why? How? Where? Remember, form
                    should follow function. The building you design should be markedly
                    different from today's regular house. That means you may not submit
                    plans for a single family residence or house for one woman.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ...Pay particular attention to sensory perception and
                    the function of your building, i.e. how sight, smell, hearing, taste,
                    and touch should affect the design outcome. ...Make sure your building has a name. What are its
                    strengths and weaknesses?

                Upon class confusion, the teacher elaborated further:

                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    ...the women's world assignment is a bit free-flowing just to try to
                    prevent you from feeling restricted in how you approach it, though I
                    apologize if that makes it unclear.&nbsp; Basically, your task is to imagine
                    a space that would be ideal for women, in that it would eliminate some
                    of the problems that we face in our real world context today.&nbsp; The
                    space you design (say, a small village, or a building) should show how
                    life would be different in this world you've imagined--that's the
                    important part, that your uploaded image makes it clear how life is
                    very different in the imagined world.&nbsp; Your blog entry can fill in
                    details that aren't necessarily clear in the image itself.

                </div>
                <br />
                I found this assignment incredibly difficult. From the very beginning, I recoil at accusations that sky-scrapers have more to do with penis-worship than simple efficiency: people all want to live in one condensed place, so we build up, rather than sprawl out. Doors aren't yonic symbols, they're the only means of closing off walls. At least limited I cannot think of another means. And surely walls aren't themselves a contraption dreamt-up by the patriarchy to keep women down! If one would assert so, I would think they would also have to argue that privacy itself is an invention of the patriarchy. "A woman-run world would have no walls and we would all copulate in the open." This seems like absolute nonsense to me.
                <br />
                <br />
                But for the sake of the assignment, I read the next two paragraphs of the description with the assumption that the first one implied profound truths. But the answers to all the questions seemed obvious and un-insightful. Where do women find the things they need? In department stores, in libraries, in music, in friends, in blank canvases. What do they want? <a title="The same thing all humans want" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_human_needs" id="ae22">The same thing all humans want</a>. Where/how do they dwell? In houses, in huts, in mansions, in boxes! The same places as men, and in which I already stated I see no genderization. How do women move from place to place? They walk, they bike, they drive, they bus, they train, they fly. None of these provided any insight into how a place designed explicitly for women would be any different than a place built explicitly for men. That is, unless I espoused gross stereotypes as definitive: "women like pink things and soft things".
                <br />
                <br />
                After several hours of contemplation and discussion with male and female friends, all I could come up with that would definitely be different in a woman-centric world is that toilets would not have movable seats, and bathtubs would perhaps be large enough to birth in. But woe is me, for upon reading her extended instructions, I found that I should create "a small village, or a[n entire] building" that "would eliminate...problems that we face...today," and would make life "very different." But I argue vehemently against the notion that our architecture has any significant impact on the rampant sexism in our society when compared to bad education and media entrenchment (isn't that just more education?). 
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm not a professional on the topic, but I would assume that the first person to build structures in each society thought much more about the ease of building it, the ability to fit lots of people into one space, and perhaps his own artistic sense than he did about keeping women down. And while he might have been a frightful misogynist, his hatred of women would have had a negligible effect on his architectural sense, I would assert.
                <br />
                <br />
                And so, here you are. All I thought of is a nicely-sized bathtub, a shower with a chair (large enough to comfortably shave your legs in if you so choose), and a toilet with a permanent seat. I can't think of how a woman-centric sink would be any different than our current (apparently man-centered) sinks; or how walls, doors, steps, building shapes, windows, flooring, colors, light-fixtures, floor-plans, city-scapes, city-planning, or anything else in our patriarchal society could possibly be made intrinsically more female-accommodating. Everything but the basics is, I assert, a matter of personal preference, and cannot possibly be made better for all females everywhere in one fell swoop.
                <br />
				<p></p><a href="images/womanbathroom.jpg"><img src="images/womanbathroomsmall.jpg" title="spacious & without shelving" alt="a circular bathroom"/></a></p><br /><br />
				I didn't add shelving for towels or a spigot for the shower, but I think it's a solid start to a fabulous bathroom. Would all women like it? No. But I would.<br />

                    For this assignment, we had to create an imitation of the <a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/gateway/passages/sappho.htm">Sappho poem</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made two. I never finished the first one I started, but these ones were coming out better anyhow:
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4>Version 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Oh that silly man with his Divine attributes with which only you could fill him with your laughter, with your words,
                </p>
                <p>
                    with your sweet laughter my heart wings, with your mere glance i have nothing in me to say
                </p>
                <p>
                    no words can pass my clunky tongue and my skin holds back fire and dark. there is no light left and all i hear is oceans
                </p>
                <p>
                    rivers running down quaking earth of me. paler than grass me. i am near death (or nearly)
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4>Version 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Your laughter-light shining on merely him makes him seem a God, or at least a god. Your gentle, fluttering Words land on him, kiss his blessed skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The You-shine makes the door of my heart-box rattle and all the feelings squeeze out the cracks. Just a simple glance from you and the lid to my voice, which was lost, is found again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My tongue engine seizes and fires ignite beneath my normally well-oiled skin; my eyes come unplugged, my ears fill with static.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I shake and I sweat. I am paler than autumnal grass, shorn too short all summer. I think I nearly die.

                    For this first assignment, we were introduced to Feminist Theory, the <a href="http://www.guerrillagirls.com/">Guerrilla Girls</a>, and each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an introduction to me:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Name, and anything interesting you have to say about it.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Chad Anthony Eric Ostrowski - My mom's dad also had two middle names. I have dos because my older brother (three at the time) really wanted me to be named Eric. My padres conceded with a second middle name.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Major/year.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Engineering Science and Electrical Engineering. Last semester, the ninth one. I'd have graduated on time had I not wasted a semester in IST.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place of origin.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Conceived on a camping trip in June. Not sure where. Born in Connecticut. Raised in central Pennsylvania (Yeagertown, next to Lewistown).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Favorite TV show. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I only watch TV when other people turn it on. So that means I mainly watch Gilmore Girls and What Not to Wear. I prefer the latter. Cake Boss is pretty funny, too.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most detested food. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I always hated tomatoes. I have been trying half-heartedly to make myself like them for four years now. It's working, ever so slowly. Let it never be said that we cannot change those traits that we deem &quot;nature&quot; rather than &quot;nurture&quot;. Our brain-canvas can always be painted over.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Last thing you read (not for a class). 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The last novel I finished reading (and didn't merely get a few pages in, like <i>100 Years of Solitude</i>) was <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i>.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Worst date. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I've only actually dated one person. We're married now. No bad dates come to mind.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Comfort level with the on-line technologies required by this course. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We'll live in the internet some day, perhaps.

                        How your gender affects your life. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        My 12th grade English teacher insisted that there was a pecking order in every graduating class and if you wanted to know what it was ask the kids at the bottom. I insisted there was none, or at least that I had always lived outside of it, blissfully unaware it existed. Certainly not at the top, and I never pecked anyone, but I was never pecked, either. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I wear girl's jeans and carry a purse (most people call it a murse, or just a bag, or a man-purse; people find it so difficult to realize that &quot;purse&quot; is just a word for &quot;a convenient bag in which you put your wallet, keys, and other frequently-needed possessions&quot;), I have a male friend who I think looks pretty fabulous in a particular red dress, and I sometimes grow my hair long. But! I can't style it! That is something that is too feminine for me to pull off! It always astounds me that there are things in society that seem to be exclusively for y-chromes and non-y-chromes still. When girls wear baggy pants around the bottom of their arse and wife-beater shirts and walk like thugs; when boys wear dresses, style their hair and put on blush--they still look queer, in every age's definition of the term! How is it possible that there is still so much work to be done in destroying societal conceptions of gender?

                        a lot, if you want some personality this answer. But I haven't had much time for it lately, and I usually view it from my Google Homepage.
